# Stock Market Data Ranking Tool

## Overview

The Stock Market Data Ranking Tool is a Python script designed to process stock market data from a CSV file and calculate the rank of each data point based on its volume relative to the volumes of previous days. It utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.

## How It Works

1. **Input Data**: The script expects the input data to be provided in a CSV file format with columns for Date, Time, and Volume. It specifically processes data related to stock market transactions.

2. **Data Processing**: Upon execution, the script reads the stock market data from the input CSV file and converts it into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

3. **Rank Calculation**: For each data point, the script calculates its rank based on its volume compared to the volumes of the previous days. The user can customize the number of previous days to consider when calculating the rank.

4. **Output Generation**: After calculating the ranks, the script generates an output CSV file ("Output.csv") containing the processed data, including the calculated ranks.

## Supported File Format

The Stock Market Data Ranking Tool works with CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files. The input CSV file should contain columns for Date, Time, and Volume, with each row representing a data point related to stock market transactions.

## Dependencies

This tool requires Python 3.x and the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system along with the Pandas library. You can install Pandas using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas
